Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set - Week1 Assignment


Try to explain in your words why a process model and architectural decision guidelines are needed in data science projects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Process Model ensures the reproducibility of the results and makes the code reusable.
Architectural decision guidelines allow the design to be open so that suboptimal decisions can be detected, criticized and corrected.
Both process model and decision guidelines promotes collaboration between all parties involved in the project




Please describe your use case and data set

Please describe your use case and data set

I'll use the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set"
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
This dataset was built thanks to experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

The aim is to predict the activity performed from the signals measured by the smartphone sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope)
