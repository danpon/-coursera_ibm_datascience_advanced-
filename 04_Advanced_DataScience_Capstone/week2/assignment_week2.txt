Try to explain in your words why data clensing and feature creation is one of the most important tasks in data science
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the time raw data can not be  exploited directly.
To build a model, data must be numeric (a collection of texts may be transformed for instance in a tf-idf matrix).
Some algorithms can not process categorical variables so these variables should be transformed
(one-hot encoding being a solution here).
Missing values should be either discarded or imputed since some ML tools won't work if all values are not present.
Invalid data can make  predictions totally useless ("garbage in, garbage out").
Outliers can  be strongly bias results.
