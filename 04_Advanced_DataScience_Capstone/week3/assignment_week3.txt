Try to explain in your words why you have selected a particular type of machine model to start with

One of the main issue in HAR (Human Activity Recognition) is features selection.
With traditional ML methods this selection requires human expertise in the a specific field (kinetic signals).
On the other hand deep learning algorithms, for instance CNN are able to  detect spatial and temporal dependencies in the signals.
In other words, CNN are able to automatically select the more relevant features in  high dimension datasets.
This is why we'll use CNN in our capstone project.
